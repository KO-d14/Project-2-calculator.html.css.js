# Project-2-calculator.html.css.js

This project was created in order to understand how to write HTML, CSS, and JS code. 

However looking back at my past projects, I realized how unstructured I was as I jumped too quickly on attempting to write JS code thus only following 
codes given from online tutorials. 

(This is before using FCC.)
